Description: # fairkit-learn fairness toolkit
        
        Fairkit-learn is an open-source, publicly available Python toolkit designed
        to help data scientists evaluate and explore machine learning models with
        respect to quality and fairness metrics simultaneously.
        
        Fairkit-learn builds on top of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the state-of-the-art tool suite
        for data mining and data analysis, and [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/), the state-of-the-art
        Python toolkit for examining, reporting, and mitigating machine learning bias
        in individual models. 
        
        Fairkit-learn supports all metrics and learning algorithms available in scikit-learn and AI Fairness
        360, and all of the bias mitigating pre- and post-processing algorithms available in AI Fairness 360, and provides extension points to add more metrics and algorithms.
