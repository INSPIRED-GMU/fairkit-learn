The models you will be evaluating are as follows:\n","\n","* **Logistic Regression**: a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability. [More info here.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/logistic-regression-for-machine-learning/) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)\n","* **K Nearest Neighbor Classifier**: a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses test data to make an “educated guess” on what an unclassified point should be classified as. [More info here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)\n","* **Random Forest**: an ensemble machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression problems. Random forest applies the technique of bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to decision tree learners. [More info here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)\n","* **Support Vector Classifier**:  a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.
