    "# Tutorial 1: fairkit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to use fairkit-learn to train and evaluate machine learning models. This tutorial will use the following models, bias mitigation algorithms, and metrics provided by scikit-learn and AI Fairness 360.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are a variety of models provided by scikit-learn and AI Fairness 360, we will only use a subset for this assignment. The models you will be evaluating are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression**: a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability. [More info here.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/logistic-regression-for-machine-learning/) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)\n",
    "* **K Nearest Neighbor Classifier**: a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses test data to make an “educated guess” on what an unclassified point should be classified as. [More info here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)\n",
    "* **Random Forest**: an ensemble machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression problems. Random forest applies the technique of bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to decision tree learners. [More info here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)\n",
    "* **Support Vector Classifier**:  a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side. [More info here.](https://medium.com/machine-learning-101/chapter-2-svm-support-vector-machine-theory-f0812effc72) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)\n",
    "* **Adversarial Debiasing**: learns a classifier to maximize prediction accuracy and simultaneously reduce an adversary's ability to determine the protected attribute from the predictions. [Documentation.](https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/inprocessing.html#adversarial-debiasing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adversarial Debiasing model is only available for use when using AI Fairness 360 or fairkit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias Mitigating Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI Fairness 360 and fairkit-learn, you will have access to the following bias mitigating pre- and post- processing algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-processing algorithms**\n",
    "    - *Disparate Impact Remover*: a preprocessing technique that edits feature Values increase group fairness while preserving rank-ordering within groups\n",
    "    - *Reweighing*: a preprocessing technique that Weights the examples in each (group, label) combination differently to ensure fairness before classification\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Post-processing algorithms**\n",
    "    - *Calibrated Equalized Odds*: a post-processing technique that optimizes over calibrated classifier score outputs to find probabilities with which to change output labels with an equalized odds objective\n",
    "    - *Reject Option Classification*: a postprocessing technique that gives favorable outcomes to unpriviliged groups and unfavorable outcomes to priviliged groups in a confidence band around the decision boundary with the highest uncertainty \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate your trained models, you will be using one or more of the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance metrics**:\n",
    "    - *Accuracy Score* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.accuracy_score) When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *maximize* the value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Fairness Metrics**:\n",
    "    - *Equal Opportunity Difference* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.equal_opportunity_difference) also known as \"true positive rate difference\". When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *minimize* the value.\n",
    "    - *Average Odds Difference* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.average_odds_difference) When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *minimize* the value.\n",
    "    - *Statistical Parity Difference* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.mean_difference) also known as \"mean difference\". When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *minimize* the value.\n",
    "    - *Disparate Impact* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.disparate_impact)  When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *maximize* the value."
