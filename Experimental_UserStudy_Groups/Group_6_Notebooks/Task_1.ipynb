    "\n",
    "Today, we will use machine learning tools to train models while being careful of model fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will use **fairkit-learn** to train and evaluate models using the ProPublica COMPAS Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will use **scikit-learn** to train and evaluate models using the German Credit Dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will use **AI Fairness 360** to train and evaluate models using the Adult Census Income Dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the provided tooling and resources within this notebook, you will be allowed to use outside resources (e.g. Google) to help you complete this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please plan to complete the entire exercise in one sitting. Make sure you have time and your computer is plugged into power before you start; you'll be running machine learning algorithms, which will wear your battery down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses for this exercise will be entered in the <a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/92474488429169\" target=\"_blank\">Evaluating ML Models Exercise Response Form</a>. You will first be asked some demographic questions then each page that follows maps to each task you complete.

    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are a variety of models provided by scikit-learn and AI Fairness 360, we will only use a subset for this assignment. The models you will be evaluating are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression**: a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability. [More info here.](https://machinelearningmastery.com/logistic-regression-for-machine-learning/) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)\n",
    "* **K Nearest Neighbor Classifier**: a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses test data to make an “educated guess” on what an unclassified point should be classified as. [More info here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)\n",
    "* **Random Forest**: an ensemble machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression problems. Random forest applies the technique of bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to decision tree learners. [More info here.](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)\n",
    "* **Support Vector Classifier**:  a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side. [More info here.](https://medium.com/machine-learning-101/chapter-2-svm-support-vector-machine-theory-f0812effc72) [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)\n",
    "* **Adversarial Debiasing**: learns a classifier to maximize prediction accuracy and simultaneously reduce an adversary's ability to determine the protected attribute from the predictions. [Documentation.](https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/inprocessing.html#adversarial-debiasing)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Bias Mitigating Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "When using AI Fairness 360 and fairkit-learn, you will have access to the following bias mitigating pre- and post- processing algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-processing algorithms**\n",
    "    - *Disparate Impact Remover*: a preprocessing technique that edits feature Values increase group fairness while preserving rank-ordering within groups\n",
    "    - *Reweighing*: a preprocessing technique that Weights the examples in each (group, label) combination differently to ensure fairness before classification\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Post-processing algorithms**\n",
    "    - *Calibrated Equalized Odds*: a post-processing technique that optimizes over calibrated classifier score outputs to find probabilities with which to change output labels with an equalized odds objective\n",
    "    - *Reject Option Classification*: a postprocessing technique that gives favorable outcomes to unpriviliged groups and unfavorable outcomes to priviliged groups in a confidence band around the decision boundary with the highest uncertainty \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate your trained models, you will be using one or more of the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance metrics**:\n",
    "    - *Accuracy Score* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.accuracy_score) When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *maximize* the value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Fairness Metrics**:\n",
    "    - *Equal Opportunity Difference* (UnifiedMetricLibrary.equal_opportunity_difference) also known as \"true positive rate difference\". When evaluating a model with this metric, the goal is to *minimize* the value.\n",

    "Your turn! Use what you learned in the above tutorial to train and evaluate models for performance, fairness, and overall quality. You will use functionality provided by fairkit-learn to meet the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Describe a model you believe will perform the best (e.g., have the highest accuracy score).** \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Describe a model you believe will be the most fair, regardless of performance (e.g., minimizes the value of difference fairness metrics or maximizes disparate impact).** \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Describe a model you believe will best balance both performance and fairness (e.g., have the highest classifier quality score).** \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you include any modifications to model hyper-parameters and any pre-/post-processing algorithms used. **As a reminder, there is no \"absolute best\" model for each of the above goals. You are expected to explore the space of model configurations available to find a model that best meets the above goals.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind, training machine learning models is often a time intensive endeavor.** One way you can minimize time to finish this task is to minimize the search space (e.g., number of models included in a single search). You can also minimize time when evaluating the number of times you have to, for example, train a given model to then evaluate it. You can do this by putting the code that initializes and trains your model(s) in its own separate cell and only execute this cell when needed.\n",
